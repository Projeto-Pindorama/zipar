``zipar`` is a program that extracts, lists ~~and creates~~ (TODO)
[PKZIP](https://support.pkware.com/pkzip/appnote)-compatible files, but using
a ``tar``(1)-like interface inspired on
[Schily's tar](https://cdrtools.sourceforge.net/old/private/man/star/star.1.html)
and [Heirloom (UNIX v7) tar](http://heirloom-ng.pindorama.net.br/manual/man1/tar.1.html).  
It is the first program to ever making use of the
[libcmon](https://pindorama.net.br/libcmon), which is still on testing and with
features being gradually implemented.
